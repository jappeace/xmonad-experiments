This is an exploration of xmonad.

At the moment I just tried it out on a ubuntu vm.
In the future I may set it up up for nixos vm as well

We got a basic setup working with xmobar.
Concretely what needs to be done is:

+ Make the keybindings behave like i3.
+ Bind certain programs to keys (like firefox or rofi)
+ Look at other peoples config and see what they're doing with xmonad.
+ As mentioned before, make a virtual box vm with nix.
+ Load skybro's config and look at typesignatures (for fun)
